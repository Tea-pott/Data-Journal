In this my blog where I'm going to briefly tell you, how I began gaining interest in Data Science and what I'm doing to learn.

Back then as a 19 year old I decided to study applied chemistry in my bachelors and then for my masters, I applied and got admission to material sciecne in Germany which I started couple years back. It has always been appealing for me to do something in software development and I knew it's going to be a very useful skill for doing all sorts of things. For me, it was something that I could gain magical powers with to do cool stuff and build tools that make tasks much easier and help people in one way or another but never thought of giving up chemistry all together to persue IT careers.  

By this point, I had tried learning python but at some point it really became difficult and couldn't do the peoject I was working on after I learning some basics and I ended up giving up after searching a lot. Finally, I decided to give it more serious try and after about two years with the help and encouragement from couple of my friends who were studying software development, I found a part time job in the university, where I got to work on python code and use linux and git which at first was overwhelming but I was enjoying the job and took one day at a time learning and working with all these tools. That was the time that Pandemic started in Europe and I had to work from home which worked out pretty good. I was taking a online course in [Coursera][Python_course] which helped a lot gaining confidence working with code and other technologies, my team was using. 

My coding skills also led me to choose a realted topic in my master thesis where I modified a model based in Fortran code (and yes it's still popular in academia) for a mineral where later on I got an offer to persue a PhD but I refused because I was detemined to learn and work on the topics and issues I am passionate about and learning programming and data science was going to give me that magical powers I was dreaming about. 

I recently started learning on my own which is a bit confusing at first because I had decide for myself what to learn first and how to learn it which needed some research like looking at university and online data science program curriculum and there are other decisions that I'll make as I go through my learning. Luckily these days, there are tons of free online material to learn all the skills for becoming a data scientis or machine learning engineer and lots of people who already did what I'm going to do and wrote about their experiences.

I'm going to write another post for the material I'm using for my learning which I'll update as I go.
